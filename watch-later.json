    "description" : "Investing 101 FREE ebook: http://theminoritymindset.com/get-richer-sleeping-ebook/\nSUBSCRIBE for the latest videos *NEW VIDEOS EVERY WEEK* \nSC @M2JaspreetSingh\nhttp://www.TheMinorityMindset.com\n\nThe Minority Mindset has nothing to do with the way you look, your background, or ethnicity. It's a mindset. \n\nWhat Is The Minority Mindset? | Minority Mindset \nHi my name is Jaspreet Singh & welcome to the Minority Mindset \nOh what is the Minority Mindset? The minority mindset is a mindset that only a minority of people have.\n\nI’m Aman. It doesn’t matter what color, background, or race you are. Anyone can have the minority mindset, but that means you have to think different than the majority. \n\nLet me tell you who we are by telling you what we are not. We are not some financial class or guru, trying to sell you a boot camp on how to get rich.\n\nWe aren’t your BLEEP mom either whose going to say everything will be okay and sugar coat things to be nice that’s better\n\nListen life isn’t fair. Some of us have to work harder than other people. If you want to be a winner stop complaining like a loser and get what you want.\n\nWe’re entrepreneurs supporting you entrepreneurs, because no one supported me or me as entrepreneurs.\n\nThe majority likes to sit and complain about their problems. The minority finds solutions \n\nIf you give the majority $200 they will come back with a pair of Jordans If you give the minority $200 they will come back with $2000 \n\nThe majority wanted to dig for gold, the minority sold them shovels \n\nThink from the mindset of the consumer and be the provider. That’s the minority mindset. \n\nBeing an entrepreneur isn’t easy. I get it. THAT’s why I created Minority Mindset as a free way to help guide entrepreneurs, you can watch us on YouTube, listen to us on Podcast, or read our free ebook on investing so you can get your money working for you by clicking this link right here\n\nPeople are making millions off of Snapchat, Instagram, and rocks. You can make money doing anything, \nJ The majority will say this is stupid and that success is unrealistic. And that’s fine,  that’s why it will always be unrealistic for them. For everyone else, well . That’s why we have the minority mindset. So subscribe to the Minority Mindset YouTube channel right now so you don’t miss any of our new videos on entrepreneurship, business, and money. But nothings possible unless you change your mindset to see the possibilities.\n\n#MinorityMindset #Entrepreneurship #FinancialLiteracy #Mindset \n\nInstagram: http://www.Instagram.com/MinorityMindset\nFacebook: http://www.Facebook.com/MinorityMindset\n\nhttp://www.TheMinorityMindset.com\nThis Video: https://youtu.be/0kqTgT4e1cU\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/c/MinorityMindset\n\nBased in Detroit.\n\nVideo by: Manpreet Gujral\nMG Studios",

    "description" : "Works for Linux Mint 17, 18, and 19! Learn the 5 easy steps to download & install Linux Mint on your PC while keeping Windows at the same time!\n\nDOWNLOAD LINKS:\nDeluge (torrent download client) - http://deluge-torrent.org\nLinux Mint 18.2 ISO Image - https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=237\nRufus (Live USB Creator tool) - http://rufus.akeo.ie\n\nMORE INFORMATION ON TORRENTS\nUsing a torrent or bittorrent client means that you will be downloading the Mint ISO file from other users around the world who are also using a torrent client: it's called a p2p, or peer-to-peer, connection. Once the download is complete, the torrent program will begin \"seeding\" the Mint ISO. In other words, it will make the Mint ISO file available to other torrent users, and can possibly use your Internet bandwidth to upload the Mind ISO file for other users. \n\nTo stop sharing the Mint ISO file after the download is complete, either uninstall Deluge, or (1) Go into the Deluge program, (2) Right-click on the Mint ISO file name in the main Deluge window, (3) Left-click \"Remove torrent\", (4) Once the new window opens up, left-click \"Remove torrent\" again. Deluge will no longer take up your Internet bandwidth to share the ISO file. Good to go! :)",

    "description" : "A wobbly washing machine isn’t just a noisy nuisance, it actually affects the performance of your wash.\n\nIf you’ve recently installed a new washing machine, you may find that\nit’s not completely flush with your floor. This wobble can cause a lot of unwanted noise during a wash, especially during the spin cycle. A wobbly machine is also the number one cause of spin cycle problems. So if your washer won’t spin up to its full speed, or appears to spin poorly; check for that wobble, it could be the cause.\n\nThe good news is fixing the dreaded wobbles is very easy, we simply\nadjust the four feet under the machine.\n\nHowever, it’s a two person job. Please don’t try and do it on your own.\n\nTo help work out which feet need adjusting, work corner-to-corner. Make sure you adjust all four feet, not just the front ones.\n\nTo order any replacement parts or to book one of our local Hotpoint engineers, visit https://www.indesitservice.co.uk/",

    "description" : "First-order logic – also known as first-order predicate calculus and predicate logic – is a collection of formal systems used in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as Socrates is a man one can have expressions in the form \"there exists X such that X is Socrates and X is a man\" where there exists is a quantifier and X is a variable.This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers.\n\nClick here to subscribe well Academy\nhttps://www.youtube.com/wellacademy1\n\nFacebook Me : https://goo.gl/2zQDpD\n\n\nThank you for watching share with your friends \nFollow on :\nFacebook page : https://www.facebook.com/wellacademy/\nInstagram page : https://instagram.com/well_academy\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/well_academy\nGoogle+ :https://plus.google.com/+WellAcademy1\n\nfirst order logic in ai,\nfirst order logic tutorial,\nfirst order logic in artificial intelligence examples,\nfirst order logic to cnf,\nfirst order logic examples,\nfirst order logic,\nfirst order logic artificial intelligence,\nfirst order logic ai,\nfirst order predicate logic in artificial intelligence,\nfirst order logic in artificial intelligence in hindi,\nfirst order logic basics,\nfirst order logic examples artificial intelligence,\nfirst order logic in hindi",

    "description" : "Paid sick leave keeps everyone healthier. During a pandemic, it's a necessity.\n\nBecome a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab\n\nIn most developed countries, workers have the right to a certain number of paid sick days. It’s a policy that isn’t rooted in just generosity — during pandemics like the novel coronavirus, it can literally save lives. \n\nWhen workers have to choose between earning a living and staying home sick, it incentivizes them to come to work when they're ill, and potentially infect their colleagues and anyone else they come into contact with. That’s why public health officials are concerned that millions of American workers don’t have access to paid sick days. And a disproportionate share of those workers are concentrated in occupations like food service and hospitality, where there’s potential to infect the hundreds of customers many of them interact with every day.\n\nCorrection: At 1:18, islands in Canada, Denmark, Japan, Italy, and Australia are missing highlights.\n\nPrevious headline: One policy that changes the coronavirus math\n\nFurther reading:\nThe Italian Ministry of Health \nhttps://www.thelocal.it/20200309/map-which-parts-of-italy-are-affected-by-coronavirus-outbreak\n\nWorld Health Organization\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic#/media/File:2020_coronavirus_cases_outside_China.svg\n\nCenter for Economic and Policy Research\nhttps://media.milanote.com/p/files/1Jcvmg1vhFTY82/Rt8/CEPR%20-%20paid%20sick%20leave%20in%2022%20countries%20%282020%20update%29.pdf\n\nPew Research Center\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/12/as-coronavirus-spreads-which-u-s-workers-have-paid-sick-leave-and-which-dont/\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html\n\nA Better Balance\nhttps://www.abetterbalance.org/resources/map-of-paid-sick-time-laws/\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel\nhttp://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/33874059.html\n\nWisconsin State Legislature\nhttps://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/proposals/sb23\n\nPR Watch\nhttps://www.prwatch.org/files/ALEC%20Labor%20Business%20Reg%20Subcttee%20Annual%20Mtg%202011.pdf#8\n\nEconomic Policy Institute\nhttps://www.epi.org/preemption-map/\n\nHouse Democrats (via CNN)\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/politics/coronavirus-house-economic-bill/index.html\n\nUS House of Representatives\nhttps://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20200309/BILLS-116hr6201-SUS.pdf\n\nThe New York Times\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-paid-sick-leave.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

    "description" : "In this python for data science tutorial, you will learn about how to do principal component analysis (PCA) and Singular value decomposition (SVD) in python using seaborn, pandas, numpy and pylab. environment used is Jupyter notebook.  \n\nThis is the 19th  Video of Python for Data Science Course! In This series I will explain to you Python and Data Science all the time! It is a deep rooted fact, Python is the best programming language for data analysis because of its libraries for manipulating, storing, and gaining understanding from data. Watch this video to learn about the language that make Python the data science powerhouse. Jupyter Notebooks have become very popular in the last few years, and for good reason. They allow you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and markdown text. This can all be run from directly in the browser. It is an essential tool to learn if you are getting started in Data Science, but will also have tons of benefits outside of that field. Harvard Business Review named data scientist \"the sexiest job of the 21st century.\" Python pandas is a commonly-used tool in the industry to easily and professionally clean, analyze, and visualize data of varying sizes and types. We'll learn how to use pandas, Scipy, Sci-kit learn and matplotlib tools to extract meaningful insights and recommendations from real-world datasets",

Meditation music recordings also include reiki music, Zen meditation music and deep trance hypnosis sessions.\nWe compose instrumental and electronic music that is specially designed to enhance brain function and concentration, spa and massage therapy, and healing music therapy. For this reason, we use binaural beats. There are many types of beats for different daily meditation purposes: Delta Waves – Sleep Music / NREM sleep, Alpha Waves are neural oscillations, Theta Waves (Cortical theta rhythm and Hippocampal theta rhythm). Beta waves associated with muscle contractions in isotonic movements, Gamma waves can help to release serotonin, endorphin and dopamine, so it works as happiness music for depression treatment.  \n* Sleep Music – Insomnia Music:\nGreenred Productions deep sleep music sessions have been specifically created to relax mind and body physically and mentally. Brainwave sessions are suitable for everyone including babies, children, and adults. Sleep hypnosis is based on beautifully slow, soft, soothing music to help you to fall asleep within minutes, naturally and without the aid of medication. These sleep meditation sessions will put you into relaxing healing sleep and will train your mind to fall asleep effortlessly. \nRelaxing sounds of nature combined with soothing music offers you a peaceful sleep. Would you like to learn to control your dreams, overcome nightmares? Lucid dream meditation sessions will help you to get into a deep state of relaxation and have a more pleasant sleep. Say no to sleep insomnia! Lucid Dreaming and Astral Travel music episodes are the most popular. \n* Study Music and Focus Music:\nStudy Music & Concentration Music is brainwave background music to help you to study, focus, and concentrate on learning process and work more effectively. Alpha Waves help your mind to get to the state of focus, which is perfect for studying or preparing for exam or test you have at school or university. It also maintains your alertness while studying. Beta waves will help to concentrate for tasks, enhance intelligence.\n\n~ My other channels: \nSub Bass Meditation Music ► https://goo.gl/Q3dSdU\nMeditation Cloud ► https://goo.gl/oGVo9F\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n- FACEBOOK\nhttps://goo.gl/FfNFoa\n- Twitter\nhttps://goo.gl/BmEf8o\n- Our website\nhttps://goo.gl/SWuQNw",

By Karen Dawisha\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVladimir Putin has been ruling Russia since 1999. In that time he has shaped the country into an authoritarian and militaristic society. The Soviet Union dissolved into 15 new countries, including the new Russian Federation. In Putin’s eyes, Russia had just lost 2 million square miles of territory. But Putin’s regime has also developed and fostered the most effect cyber hacker army in the world and he’s used it to wreak havoc in the West. But the election of Donald Trump brings new hope for the Putin vision. Trump’s rhetoric has been notably soft on Russia. He could lift sanctions and weaken NATO, potentially freeing up space for Putin’s Russia to become a dominant power once again. \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

But as the weather gets warmer, public places start to open up, and many places enter their fourth month of life under coronavirus, that’s becoming less and less realistic.\n\nAt the same time, we know that coronavirus can be transmitted through the air -- and that raises some pretty big questions. Is it safe to go the beach? What about a park? Is a heavy-breathing runner going to infect you as they pass you? In short: How do you go outside safely?\n\nRead Vox reporter Sigal Samuel’s article about the risks of transmitting Covid-19 outdoors: https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/4/24/21233226/coronavirus-runners-cyclists-airborne-infectious-dose\n\nA helpful chart for thinking through the risks of different scenarios when it comes to Covid-19: https://www.vox.com/2020/5/22/21266756/coronavirus-pandemic-covid-risks-social-distancing-chart\n\nThe CDC’s study about the Guangzhou restaurant where one person transmitted the virus to several others: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0764_article\n\nAnd the study of the 318 outbreaks in China: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053058v1\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

    "description" : "The 2019 fires were just the tip of the iceberg. \n\nThis is Part 1 of Vox Atlas: The Amazon, a three-part series about the world's largest rainforest, why it's in jeopardy, and the people trying to save it. Watch all three parts right here on YouTube.\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/SAZAKPUQMw0\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/e1_4JseKlO4\nPart 3: https://youtu.be/oGjRNbXeRXI\n\nBecome a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab\n\nThe Amazon rainforest has been reduced by about 17% since the 1970s. Cattle ranchers, loggers, and farmers are mostly to blame for the deforestation, but the demand driving them comes from all around the world. Brazil's economy depends on agriculture, especially beef and soy, which is grown on cleared land in the Amazon. Today, president Jair Bolsonaro, is weakening the environmental protections there in order to give agriculture more power. This came to a head when, in summer 2019, more than 30,000 wildfires burned in the Amazon, sparking worldwide outrage. \n\nHere are some sources I found particularly helpful while reporting for this story:\n\nNepstad, et al. 2014 https://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6188/1118\nUmair Irfan, Vox: https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/11/18/20970604/amazon-rainforest-2019-brazil-burning-deforestation-bolsonaro\nThe Intercept: https://theintercept.com/2019/07/06/brazil-amazon-rainforest-indigenous-conservation-agribusiness-ranching/\n\nVox Atlas demonstrates where conflicts occur on a map and the ways in which foreign policy shapes a region.
